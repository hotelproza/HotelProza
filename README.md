# PROZA — hotelproza.ge (Static site)

This folder contains a ready-to-publish static website (HTML/CSS/JS + images).

## Publish on GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (Public is easiest).
2. Upload everything from this folder to the repository root.
3. GitHub → Settings → Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` / (root)
4. Your site will be available at:
   `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`

## Custom domain later (optional)
When you buy the domain, you can connect it in GitHub Pages → Custom domain.
